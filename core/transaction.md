# What is a Transaction?

Most blockchains are designed as a distributed and decentralized digital ledger. In simple terms, blockchain is a digital ledger that is basically an electronic version of a paper ledger, and it is responsible for recording a list of transactions.

More specifically, a blockchain is a linear chain of multiple blocks that are connected and secured by cryptographic proofs. Blockchain technology may also be applied in other activities that do not necessarily require financial operations, but in the cryptocurrencies context, they are responsible for keeping a permanent record of all confirmed transactions.

'Distributed' and 'decentralized' refers to the way the ledger is structured and maintained. To understand the difference, think about common forms of centralized ledgers such as public records of home sales, a bank's record of ATM withdrawals, or eBay's list of sold items. In every case, only one organization controls the ledger: a government agency, the bank, or eBay. Another common factor is that there's only one master copy of the ledger and anything else is simply a backup that is not the official record. Therefore, traditional ledgers are centralized because they are maintained by a single entity and are usually reliant on a single database.
