# Type of Blockchains

Currently there are four types of blockchain networks.

1. Private Blockchain Network

    Private Blockchain are run and controlled by a single organisation that determines who can read, write and participate in consensus process. Since they are 100% centralised, private blockchain is useful for sandbox environments and not for Production.

2. Semi-private Blockchain Network

    This network is run by a single company that grants access to any user who satisfy pre-established criteria. Although it not truly decentralised, this solution is appealing to business-to-business use cases and government applications.

3. Consortium Blockchain Network

    In consortium blockchain, the consensus process in handled by a group of people. The right to read and write maybe public or restricted to a participant. Consortium blockchain are considered to be "permissioned blockchains" and best suited for organisations and enterprises.  

4. Public Blockchain Network

    Anyone can read, write transaction to the network, or participate in the consensus process. They are considered to be "permissionless". Every transaction is public, and user can remain anonymous.
