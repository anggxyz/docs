Matic Network is a scaling solution for public blockchains. Based on an adapted implementation of Plasma framework (Plasma MoreVP) - with an account based implementation (read more [here](https://ethresear.ch/t/account-based-plasma-morevp/5480)), Matic supports all the existing Ethereum tooling along with faster and cheaper transactions.

### What is a Sidechain?
Think of Sidechain is a clone of 'parent' blockchain, supporting transfer of assets to and fro the main chain. It is simply an alternate to parent chain that creates a new blockchain with its own mechanism of creating blocks (consensus mechanism). Connecting a sidechain to a parent chain involves setting up a method of moving assets between the chains.

### What is Plasma?
Plasma is a framework of child chains - it is a scaling solution for Ethereum (or any blockchain for that matter).
