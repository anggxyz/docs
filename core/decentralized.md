# Decentralized Systems
Blockchain takes its name from the way records are organized: a chain of linked blocks. Basically speaking, a block is a piece of data that contains, among other things, a list of recent transactions (like a printed page of entries). The blocks, as well as the transactions, are public and visible, but they cannot be altered (like putting each page into a sealed glass box). As new blocks are added to the blockchain, a continuous record of linked blocks is formed (like a physical ledger and its many pages of records). This was a very simple analogy, but the process is much more complex than that.

One of the main reasons why blockchains are so resistant to modification is the fact that the blocks are linked and secured by cryptographic proofs. In order to produce new blocks, participants of the network need to engage in a costly and intensive computational activity known as mining. Basically, miners are responsible for verifying transactions and grouping them into newly created blocks that are then added to the blockchain (if certain conditions are met). They are also responsible for introducing new coins into the system, which are issued as a reward for their job.

Every new confirmed block is linked to the block that came immediately before it. The beauty of this setup is that it is practically impossible to change the data in a block once it's been added to the blockchain because they are secured by cryptographic proofs, which are very costly to be produced and extremely difficult to be undone.

Summing up, a blockchain is a chain of linked data blocks that are organized in a chronological order and are secured by cryptographic proofs.
