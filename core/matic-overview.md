# Overview
Matic Network is a scaling solution for public blockchains. Based on an adapted implementation of Plasma framework (Plasma MoreVP) - with an account based implementation (read more [here](https://ethresear.ch/t/account-based-plasma-morevp/5480)), Matic supports all the existing Ethereum tooling along with faster and cheaper transactions.

To deploy contracts on the Matic Network, you can read our tutorial on [How to deploy contracts on Matic Testnet](./tutorials/dapp.md)

The latest developer and end-user resources will be updated here on a continuous basis. The [Getting Started](https://docs.matic.network/getting-started) section is a good way to start discovering Matic Network and explore how DApps can integrate with Matic for scalable blockchain transactions.

The [matic.js tutorial](https://docs.matic.network/matic-js-tutorial) is a step-by-step tutorial that takes you through the entire deposit/transfer/withdraw flow for tokens from the Ethereum testnet to Matic testnet and vice versa.
