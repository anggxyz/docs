# Fiat-on-Ramp

Cryptocurrency is the element that adds 'value' to the ecosystem that is blockchain. But to use it, you'd require some way of getting inside the ecosystem. 

Imagine you'd want to travel to a foreign nation, you'd require the currency used there to make any good use of the products available or just to have a good time. Now there are a few ways you can obtain the said currency, 

- someone transfers you a certain amount
- you go to an 'exchange'. You give in money in the currency you currently have, the exchange hands over to you an equivalent amount of money in the currency you require
- you go empty handed, and somehow work-up a job, and start earning in that currency - highly unlikely realisticly, but very likely on Ethereum.

Easiest way ofcourse is to have some way to convert to the currency you require. "On-ramp" solutions provide this to you as a user. 

Formally said, you hand in your fiat via your credit card (having completed relevant KYC), the system provides you with equivalent cryptocurrency you require.
